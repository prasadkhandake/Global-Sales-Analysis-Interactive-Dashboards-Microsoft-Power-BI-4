# Worldwide-product-sales-analysis-report
In this project I have created worldwide product sales report using PowerBI.

Utilized Microsoft Power BI to analyze global sales trends: $29.35M in total sales, 60,000 products sold, and 18,000 customers.

Created interactive dashboards to visualize sales data by region, product category, currency (USD highest at ~$15M), and month (November highest at ~$3.10M, February lowest at ~$1.75M).
